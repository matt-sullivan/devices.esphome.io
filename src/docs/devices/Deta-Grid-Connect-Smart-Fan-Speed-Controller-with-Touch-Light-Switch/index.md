## Getting it up and running

### Series 1 - Tuya Convert

These switches are Tuya devices, so if you don't want to open them up to flash directly, you can attempt to
[use tuya-convert to initially get ESPHome onto them](/devices/tuya-convert) however recently purchased devices are no
longer Tuya-Convert compatible.  There's a useful guide to disassemble and serial flash similar switches
[on Mike McGuire's blog][2]. After that, you can use ESPHome's OTA functionality to make any further changes.

- Put the switch into "smartconfig" / "autoconfig" / pairing mode by holding any button for about 5 seconds.
- The status LED (to the side of the button(s)) blinks rapidly to confirm that it has entered pairing mode.

### Series 2 - Cloudcutter

[Cloudcutter](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter) is a tool designed to simplify the flashing process.
Follow the [official guide](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter) for instructions.

### Manual Flashing

If you prefer to flash manually, you'll need a USB to serial adapter. Follow the disassembly steps below:

1. Remove the front plastic face.
2. Unscrew the exposed screws.
3. Remove the clear panel and the small PCB underneath.

## Configuration Examples
